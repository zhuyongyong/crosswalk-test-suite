      <strong>Test Steps:</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Get sampleRelease.apk from cordova_sampleapp.zip(you can download it from internal release link)</li>
      <li>Generate a private key using keytool:</li>
        <div>
          $ keytool -genkey -v -keystore orgtestfoo-release-key.keystore -alias mytestfoo -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000<br/>
        </div>
      <li>Sign app with the private key using jarsigner:</li>
        <div>
          $ jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore orgtestfoo-release-key.keystore sampleRelease.apk mytestfoo<br/>
        </div>
      <li>Verifies if the APK is signed:</li>
        <div>
          $ jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs sampleRelease.apk<br/>
        </div>
      <li>Align the final APK package using zipalign:</li>
        <div>
          $ zipalign -v 4 sampleRelease.apk sampleRelease-signed.apk<br/>
        </div>
      <li>Install the signed apk</li>
      <li>Launch the app</li>
      <li>Exit the app</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Expected Output:</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Sign the "sampleRelease.apk" apk successfully</li>
      <li>Install the app successfully</li>
      <li>Launch the app successfully</li>
      <li>Exit the app successfully</li>
